# mkpov
MKPOV is a collection of header/include files for the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray).
These files contain a variety of textures, normals, functions, and other pieces of code which I have written over the years and found to be useful.

More information, including example images, is located [here](http://mkukla.net/doc/mkpov/).

## Installation
Download and place files into one of POV-Ray's library paths.
